Korean Romanisation
===================

KoreanRomanisation is a C# class library for romanising Korean text.

Romanisation Systems
--------------------

### McCune-Reischauer Romanisation

### Revised Romanisation

### Simplified Romanisation

This is a special romanisation system of my own design. Many people find the McCune-Reischauer system confusing because of the diacritics, but they also find
the Revised system confusing because of the digraphs like 'eo' and 'eu'. In addition to that, many English speakers will not pronounce 'u' as in 'two' or 'blue' - 
instead they will pronounce it like 'yu' as in 'you' or 'uh' as in 'nut'. This simplified romanisation (simplified as in simplest for the reader) presents Korean
text in what is the absolute easiest way for non-Korean speakers to read.
